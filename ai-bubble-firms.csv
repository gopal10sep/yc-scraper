Mica identifies key topics from your calls, creating shareable shorts that ensure key decision-makers never miss out on important info, regardless of whether they were on the original call.

Before Mica, the founders would often be on sales calls with vendors selling their products. After the call, they'd have to explain the product to other decision-makers on their team who were not on the call in order to determine if they wanted to proceed with the vendor.

However, they would often forget important information and do a much poorer job of communicating the value propositions of the vendor compared to the sales rep, which caused deals to slow down or stop entirely. This problem cost sellers $10k-$500k+ per deal.

Sales reps wanted to show highlights from the call so everyone could get the same experience of being on the original call without having to sit through the entire call. This is why the founders started Mica.

Because brokers are involved at the heart of every CRE transaction, we are capturing this transaction data at the source, where no data company in the industry can access. The more brokerages leveraging Henry on transactions, the more unstructured data Henry can ingest. The better the data Henry stores, the better it gets at providing accurate CRE insights and completing brokers' tasks.

However, the organic growth process is highly inefficient and full of noise. Advisors often waste hours building prospect lists by aggregating information across horizontal solutions like Linkedin, ZoomInfo, Pitchbook, qualifying these leads, setting up meetings, and spending time on unqualified prospects. Advisors spend an average of 58 hours on business development for every 1 new client converted, and have <1% conversion rates.
                                                                                                                                                               
Due to the time-intensive nature of organic growth, advisors often turn to inorganic avenues for growing, via M&A, despite those being far less capital efficient.

At FINNY, we are certain we can do better with AI. With our tool, advisors can:
- Identify prospects within their target niche, aggregating thousands of data points per lead
- Prioritize prospects based on their predicted likelihood of converting, a score unique to each advisor and prospect pair
- Automate the outreach and meeting scheduling with their high priority prospects

29733,1849 bio,We make microbes enabling ultra cheap metal extraction.,"1849 bio designs microbes enabling cheap metal extraction allowing miners to unlock value from low quality copper and gold ores. Surprisingly, the mining industry is one of the largest scale users of biotech in the world with biomining processes accounting for ~1% of global copper production. Biomining is ultra-low cost, running around ~$1/ton of ore vs ~$7/ton for conventional processes. 

Unfortunately, while biomining is cheap, it can’t be applied to over 80% of copper ores, leaving vast resources without profitable extraction methods. An estimated 100M tonnes of copper sit today in waste materials and stockpiles with negative unit economics.

While a great deal of effort has been spent on optimizing microbial metal extraction processes, very little effort has been spent on optimizing the microbes themselves. 

To change that, we’re creating new biotech tools and platforms applied directly to the types of biology most relevant to miners. This enables us to develop new microbes and tackle some of the most difficult problems in biomining, unlocking billions in value from unprofitable resources while being more environmentally friendly than conventional processes.

We aim to accelerate and automate chemical process development by equipping wet-lab chemists with the power of data-driven optimization and robotic execution of experiments.

The Problem: 
The discovery of novel pharmaceuticals is one of our most important weapons in fighting disease. However, the drug development pipeline is often held up for many months during the design of chemical processes to manufacture these drugs at scale, delaying FDA trials and lengthening the time until drug launch. Designing chemical processes involves the identification of suitable parameters such as catalyst/temperature/solvent. Currently process development is often done via tedious trial and error experimentation (slow) or exhaustive screening (expensive and wasteful).

Our Approach: 
In our research we have developed algorithms for chemical process optimization which leverage transfer learning and Bayesian optimization. We validated the algorithms in the wet lab, showing an up to 95% reduction in experimental burden and cost when compared to exhaustive screening. We have made our approaches accessible to human experimentalists through our user-friendly no-code software platform, and to automated laboratory equipment with our API.

- Engineering productivity is often marred by slow CI that grows quadratically with the size of the engineering organization.
- On top of this, companies pay high markups to run CI on the hyperscalers.
- Consequently, companies have to run their CI on spot instances to keep costs in check. Since spot instances can get pre-empted at any point, running CI reliably on them requires [significant engineering investment](https://www.rippling.com/blog/how-rippling-used-spot-instances-to-save-and-scale-ci-cd).

We are starting with GitHub Actions - today's most popular and fastest-growing CI system. With a one-line change, companies can run their CI up to twice as fast on our high-performance hardware. In addition to this, Blacksmith provides colocated warm caches along with optimizations for common CI workloads (like building and pushing Docker images).

WHO: We partner with chip manufacturing, enterprise IT, and software product development teams.

WHY: Traditionally, these teams spend millions and wait months (sometimes years) to understand their complex technology infrastructure well enough to build on top of it. 

THE DRIVER DIFFERENCE: Instead, Driver AI is a tool that explains complex codebases in minutes vs. months. This enables teams to rapidly accelerate the technical discovery process and save significant resources. 

HOW IT WORKS: Driver AI works by digesting a codebase, organizing it for analysis, and harnessing Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate interactive explanations for executives, product and technology leaders, and developers.

29074,Fiber AI,We automate SDR / BDR prospecting & outbound sales workflows using AI,"Fiber AI automates SDR and BDR prospecting & outbound sales workflows using AI. Enterprises choose our AI sales platform because we automatically find prospects, research them, and hyper-personalize outbound messages that get 80% open rates, which is 4x the industry standard (our AISDR / AIBDR platform 2-4x's the reply rates you are currently getting).


Our AI sales platform consists of 3 core components:

First, Fiber AI manages domain and email health to achieve 80% open rates. We configure cold email infrastructure to maximize email deliverability. Our product will automatically configure your DNS records, warm up your emails (email warmup), orchestrate emails to send optimally across all your accounts, run multi-layer email bounce detection (email waterfall), and modify each outgoing cold outreach to ensure your cold outbound sales emails don't trigger spam filters.


Second, we automate sales lead generation with dynamic audiences (AI powered sales assistant, AI based SDR). We have B2B company data on 60 million B2B companies and 800 million B2B contacts, sourced from dozens of data providers (i.e. think sources like BuiltWith, Crunchbase, LinkedIn, ZoomInfo, SemRush, Apollo data, and more). This allows you to precisely segment your audience by the companies you care about and exclude everyone else. Our audiences are dynamic (i.e., account based marketing, account based sales, ABM), meaning we continuously look for prospects matching your targeting criteria and add them to your audience to run our automated outbound sales sequences. This automates manual workflows you might be running on platforms like Clay or Persana. You can also create an audience once based on intent signals (i.e., GTM or go-to-market signals, sales intelligence) and put your outreach on autopilot.


Lastly, our AI sales copilot (AI sales agent, AI based BDR) enables AI powered hyper-personalized emails that boost response rates. The biggest debate in sales is choosing between relevancy and personalization—now you don’t have to. We search far and wide to find the “golden nugget” of information to connect with your prospect, and then use GPT-4 to write hyper personalized email sequences that dramatically increase reply rates and book meetings.


Because of these core differences, we stand out from competitors. Products like apollo io have poor email deliverability rates that ruin email health long-term. Existing email outbound tools like amplemarket, reply io, marketo, and outreach io don't scale well and restrict you to small volumes of outbound emails. AI features to autopilot campaigns are missing in products like smartlead ai, instantly, unify gtm, penguin ai, and warmly ai. Currently, our philosophy is to allow AI to 100-1000x your team's output while maintaining extremely high email quality. AI sales copilots like reggie ai, aisdr, artisan ai / artisan sdr / artisan bdr, and others let gpt use AI to generate the entire email, which results in poor outbound email quality since SDRs/BDRs don't have fine-tune controls on the personalization.",S23,Active,"['artificial-intelligence', 'generative-ai', 'saas', 'b2b', 'sales']",San Francisco,US,2023.0,2,"['Adi Agashe', 'Neel Mehta']",8.0,https://fiber.ai/,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/fiberai/,Sales & Marketing,Sales Automation,AI-Powered Sales Engagement

Elyos Energy is helping to solve the problem of supply and demand with energy flexibility at scale, starting with the 1.6 million commercial buildings in the UK.


Our SaaS platform enables large commercial buildings to leverage their distributed energy resources (smart thermostats, HVAC systems, solar, battery) to reduce strain on the grid at hours of peak demand and lower their energy costs.

We connect to a range of APIs from smart thermostats, HVAC systems, solar, battery etc. to automate measures of energy consumption reduction and opt-in to national grid demand response events where customers can earn money for energy reduction. By shifting 10% of peak time consumption, we save companies 15% on their electricity bill and reduce their CO2 emissions by 7%.
